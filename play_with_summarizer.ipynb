      "Applications of neural networks have expanded significantly in recent years from image segmentation to natural language processing to time-series forecasting. One notably successful use of deep learning is embedding, a method used to represent discrete variables as continuous vectors. This technique has found practical applications with word embeddings for machine translation and entity embeddings for categorical variables. In this article, I’ll explain what neural network embeddings are, why we want to use them, and how they are learned. We’ll go through these concepts in the context of a real problem I’m working on: representing all the books on Wikipedia as vectors to create a book recommendation system. An embedding is a mapping of a discrete — categorical — variable to a vector of continuous numbers. In the context of neural networks, embeddings are low-dimensional, learned continuous vector representations of discrete variables. Neural network embeddings are useful because they can reduce the dimensionality of categorical variables and meaningfully represent categories in the transformed space. Neural network embeddings have 3 primary purposes: This means in terms of the book project, using neural network embeddings, we can take all 37,000 book articles on Wikipedia and represent each one using only 50 numbers in a vector. Moreover, because embeddings are learned, books that are more similar in the context of our learning problem are closer to one another in the embedding space. Neural network embeddings overcome the two limitations of a common method for representing categorical variables: one-hot encoding. The operation of one-hot encoding categorical variables is actually a simple embedding where each category is mapped to a different vector. This process takes discrete entities and maps each observation to a vector of 0s and a single 1 signaling the specific category. The one-hot encoding technique has two main drawbacks: The first problem is well-understood: for each additional category — referred to as an entity — we have to add another number to the one-hot encoded vector. If we have 37,000 books on Wikipedia, then representing these requires a 37,000-dimensional vector for each book, which makes training any machine learning model on this representation infeasible. The second problem is equally limiting: one-hot encoding does not place similar entities closer to one another in vector space. If we measure similarity between vectors using the cosine distance, then after one-hot encoding, the similarity is 0 for every comparison between entities. This means that entities such as War and Peace and Anna Karenina (both classic books by Leo Tolstoy) are no closer to one another than War and Peace is to The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy if we use one-hot encoding. Considering these two problems, the ideal solution for representing categorical variables would require fewer numbers than the number of unique categories and would place similar categories closer to one another. To construct a better representation of categorical entities, we can use an embedding neural network and a supervised task to learn embeddings. The main issue with one-hot encoding is that the transformation does not rely on any supervision. We can greatly improve embeddings by learning them using a neural network on a supervised task. The embeddings form the parameters — weights — of the network which are adjusted to minimize loss on the task. The resulting embedded vectors are representations of categories where similar categories — relative to the task — are closer to one another. For example, if we have a vocabulary of 50,000 words used in a collection of movie reviews, we could learn 100-dimensional embeddings for each word using an embedding neural network trained to predict the sentimentality of the reviews. (For exactly this application see this Google Colab Notebook). Words in the vocabulary that are associated with positive reviews such as “brilliant” or “excellent” will come out closer in the embedding space because the network has learned these are both associated with positive reviews. In the book example given above, our supervised task could be “identify whether or not a book was written by Leo Tolstoy” and the resulting embeddings would place books written by Tolstoy closer to each other. Figuring out how to create the supervised task to produce relevant representations is the toughest part of making embeddings. In the Wikipedia book project (complete notebook here), the supervised learning task is set as predicting\n",
